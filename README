A few bash aliases to help with controlling a chroot.

I use chroot to isolate servers that I might need locally for development. This way if I'm experimenting with something, it doesn't muddy the waters of my real system.

Usage:

$ source chroot_aliases
$ vm-server-start # start a chroot session in the background
$ vm-server-shell # start/attach a chroot session and start a shell in that environment
$ vm-server-stop # stop/detach a chroot session
